    <br><p>Punjab, a vibrant and culturally rich state in northern India, is often referred to as the "Land of Five Rivers." Its name is derived from the Persian words "panj" (five) and "ab" (water), highlighting the rivers Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab, and Jhelum that once flowed through the region. Known for its fertile plains, Punjab is considered the agricultural heart of India, playing a crucial role in the country's food production, particularly in wheat and rice. The state's lush green fields and hardworking farmers reflect its reputation as the "Granary of India." </p>
